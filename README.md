# Dark Theme
I always wondered how social media companies like Instagram , Twitter allowed users to choose a theme (Light, Dark) and work Efficiently in both the themes .
So I did a small project where a user can select between Light or Dark theme just by a click on a button.
# Tools Used 
- Used ReactJs to build the frontend interface.
- Used font-awesome to add icons to the Webpage. 
- Used useLocalStorage Hook which was used to store users theme preferences that stores them into users local storage.
